The folder "optional_mods" is for mods that are optional, thus not activated by default.
It would be a pain to have mods with ".jar_disabled" in the "mods" folder as it is a pain for server hosts
to change them to a ".jar", which basically they are activated, so this shall save you a lot of time when
installing/updating Wanderlust Reloaded.

Installation:
#1 Drag the mods of your liking (respect the dependencies under this) in the main "mods" folder
#2 Make sure you have all the dependencies right
#3 Delete this folder once you have all the mods you want out of "optional_mods" folder in the "mods" folder
#4 Check for dependencies again (It is important)
#5 Launch your server
#6 ???
#7 Profit and have fun playing my modpack Wanderlust Reloaded!

Dependencies among the optional mods are:

Gravisuite - Industrialcraft 2
Nuclear Control - Industrialcraft 2

Hats - iChunUtil

Opis - MobiusCore

Project Blue - ProjectRed-Base

Dependencies on default mods are:
